# Blizzard Authority Evidence

## Purpose

This document records Blizzard API evidence that informed Guild Operations' member and guild authority model. It is reference material, not the canonical definition of Guildie, authority, or persistence behavior.

Canonical contracts live in:

- [`../doctrine/member-objects.md`](../doctrine/member-objects.md)
- [`../infrastructure/authentication-ceremony.md`](../infrastructure/authentication-ceremony.md)
- [`../infrastructure/persistence-boundary.md`](../infrastructure/persistence-boundary.md)
- [`../doctrine/member-objects.md`](../doctrine/member-objects.md) — including current Guildie organizational authority derivation

## User-authorized WoW profile authority

Observed user authorization used OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with `wow.profile` and then:

```text
GET /oauth/userinfo
GET /profile/user/wow for selected region
```

The two responses supplied a corroborated Blizzard principal plus subordinate WoW accounts and controlled Character coordinates.

A controlled probe confirmed callback state round-tripping and an approximately 24-hour bearer-token lifetime. No credentials or live account-identifying values are preserved here.

## Account hierarchy evidence

Observed structure:

```text
Authenticated Blizzard principal
└── WoW Account Profile projection
    └── wow_accounts[]
        └── characters[]
```

The probe account happened to expose one WoW account and twenty Characters; those counts are observations, not invariants.

Observed identifier relationships:

```text
userinfo.id == userinfo.sub == profile.id
```

by textual value, while the top-level profile identifier differed from subordinate `wow_accounts[].id`.

A second independent OAuth ceremony confirmed stable principal/profile identifiers, WoW account identifier set, and Character coordinates for the same Blizzard user.

This evidence supports the external authority coordinate:

```text
region + Blizzard authenticated principal identifier
```

Region remains explicit because global uniqueness across regions has not been established strongly enough to remove it.

## Character-coordinate evidence

Protected Character addressing used `{realm-id}-{character-id}`, and Character coordinates remained stable across independent authorization ceremonies.

This supports:

```text
region + realm_id + character_id
```

as the durable Character coordinate rather than Character name or other mutable presentation.

## Guild-roster evidence

Live reconnaissance established the configured guild as:

```text
guild_id: 65431436
region: us
realm_id: 129
realm_slug: gurubashi
name: OH CRIT I Pulled
```

The observed roster sample contained 517 Character memberships. Comparing one authenticated account/control observation with that roster produced:

```text
authenticated controlled Characters: 20
current roster intersections: 9
```

All intersections matched by Blizzard Character and realm identifiers rather than Character name.

This evidence supports the authority derivation defined in [`../doctrine/guild-authority.md`](../doctrine/guild-authority.md).

## Rank evidence

The roster sample contained populated numeric ranks:

```text
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
```

Rank `6` was unoccupied at the time of observation. Blizzard responses did not expose the guild's custom human-readable rank names.

The evidence supports two implementation assumptions used elsewhere:

- numeric rank on current roster membership is Blizzard-owned truth;
- the complete rank-definition space must not be inferred only from currently occupied ranks.

Current capability translation is documented in [`../infrastructure/guild-permissioning.md`](../infrastructure/guild-permissioning.md).

## Region evidence

WoW Profile API requests are region/namespace scoped, for example `profile-us`. No sufficiently authoritative pre-profile region-discovery mechanism was established, so region remains explicit in the current authentication and Blizzard-principal coordinate.

## Current evidence-backed coordinates

```text
Guildie continuity
    → guildie_id

external Blizzard authority binding
    → region + authenticated principal identifier

subordinate account structure
    → WoW account identifier(s)

Character continuity
    → region + realm_id + character_id

guild continuity
    → Blizzard numeric guild_id

current guild rank
    → Blizzard numeric rank on current roster membership
```

Narrower Blizzard questions should be investigated only when concrete work requires them. New evidence should change canonical doctrine only when it materially changes what Guild Operations can legitimately assert.
